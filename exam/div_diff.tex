\section{Divided differences}
Central to our definition of B-splines is divided differences.
One simple definition of a divided difference, denoted
\begin{equation}
    [x_0, x_1, \dots, x_k]f,
\end{equation}
is that it is the leading coefficient of the polynomial which interpolates $f$ at the points $x_0, x_1, \dots, x_k$.
This is a rather cryptic definition, however it lends itself some nice properties.

\subsection{Distinct points}
If the points $x_i$ are distinct, we have that the polynomial $p$ is the Lagrange polynomial.
As such, we find that
\begin{equation}
    [x_i]f = f(x_i).
\end{equation}
For $k \geq 1$, we can define the polynomial recursively.
Let $p_0$ be the interpolating polynomial at $x_0, x_1, \dots, x_{k - 1}$ and $p_1$ the one at $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_k$.
Then we can write
\begin{equation}
    p(x) = \frac{x_k - x}{x_k - x_0} p_0(x) + \frac{x - x_0}{x_k - x_0} p_0(x).
\end{equation}
From this, we deduce that
\begin{equation}
    [x_0, x_1, \dots, x_k]f = \frac{
        [x_1, x_2, \dots, x_k]f
        - [x_0, x_1, \dots, x_{k - 1}]f
    }{x_k - x_0},
\end{equation}
such that for instance
\begin{equation}
    [x_0, x_1]f
    = \frac{[x_1]f - [x_0]f}{x_1 - x_0}
    = \frac{f(x_1) - f(x_0)}{x_1 - x_0}.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Repeated points}
When there are repeated points, we utilize the Taylor expansion in order to define
\begin{equation}
    [x_0, \dots, x_k]f = [\underbrace{x_0, \dots, x_0}_{k+1}]f = \frac{f^{(k)}(x_0)}{k!}.
\end{equation}
